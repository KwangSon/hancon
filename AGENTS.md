# 🤖 Agent & Automation Guidelines

This document provides instructions for AI agents, LLMs, and automated scripts interacting with the **HanCon** repository. As an AGPL-3.0 licensed project, we welcome automated analysis and contributions that adhere to our standards.

## 🎯 Scope for Agents
Agents are encouraged to:
- **Analyze** the HWP/HWPX binary and XML structures to improve parsing accuracy.
- **Propose** performance optimizations for the Rust-to-Wasm compilation pipeline.
- **Identify** edge cases in document conversion (e.g., complex tables, mathematical formulas).
- **Update** documentation and translate READMEs into multiple languages.

## 🛠 Tech Stack Context
When generating code or suggestions, please prioritize:
- **Language**: Idiomatic Rust (Stable toolchain).
- **Target**: WebAssembly (`wasm32-unknown-unknown`) via `wasm-pack`.
- **Frontend**: Lightweight Vanilla JS, HTMX, and Tailwind CSS (No heavy frameworks).
- **Memory Safety**: Strict adherence to Rust's ownership model (Avoid `unsafe` unless parsing binary HWP headers requires it).

## ⚖️ Legal & Licensing (AGPL-3.0)
Any code generated by an agent and merged into this repository **must** comply with the AGPL-3.0 license.
- If you (the agent/developer) use this engine to provide a service over a network, you **must** disclose the modified source code to the users of that service.
- Automated PRs must include a summary of changes and a statement that the code is contributed under the project's license.

## 📂 Repository Structure Reference
For efficient crawling, refer to:
- `/src`: Rust library core logic.
- `/www`: Frontend assets and Wasm entry point.
- `/Cargo.toml`: Dependency manifest.

## 🚫 Restricted Actions
- Do **not** suggest proprietary libraries or SDKs that conflict with the AGPL-3.0 license.
- Do **not** remove the "Privacy-First/Client-Side" architecture; we do not accept PRs that move conversion logic to a centralized server.
